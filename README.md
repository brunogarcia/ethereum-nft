# Smart Contracts

[Mint your own NFT](https://buildspace.so/p/mint-nft-collection) collection and ship a Web3 app to show them off.

Programmatically generate your own NFT collection, write + deploy a smart contract in Solidity, 
and build your own React dApp to let friends connect their wallets and interact w/ your NFTs.

## Getting Started

- ðŸ”” Rename the file `.env.example` to `.env.local`. And then add your own Quicknode API key and the Goerli testnet private key.

- ðŸ’³ You should have a installed a wallet like [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) and have some testnet ETH in it.

## Development

Run the contract on a local blockchain

```bash
npm run hh:run
```

Deploy the contract on the [Goerli testnet](https://goerli.net/)

```bash
npm run hh:deploy
```
